# Text-Detection-in-Netflix-Bitrate-menu-OCR-using-Tesseract-
In this project I manage to detect text in image with network performance values during Netfilx streaming.
I learned how to detect individual characters and words and how to place bounding boxes around them.
Using Python-tesseract an optical character recognition (OCR) tool for python and image processing techniques I succeeded to recognize and “read” the text in Netflix movies and export those values to CSV file.

*To open Netflix bitrate menu press Shift + Alt + Q on keyboard. Use screen recorder tool to record Netflix movie.

This tool performs the following steps for each frame:

1. Convert the image to GRAY format then convert it to binary image.

2. Find the borders with Canny function and cover it with two black lines (pre-process before dilate image).

3. Increase the white region in the image with dilate function. Kernel with smaller value like (2, 6) will detect
    each word instead of a line.

4. Find labels with connectedComponents function and plot rectangle around each line.

5. Send lines to Tesseract OCR model and convert it to text.
6. Create dict with all the network values using pandas library and save to CSV file.
